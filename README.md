# TESD-1400-Final-Project
This is my final project for the Southwest Technical College TESD 1400 course.

This project is a scientific calculator. It converts units and finds missing information (e.g. given 2g H2, how many grams of H2O will be produced, using the chemical reaction equation 2H2 + O2 --> 2H2O; or what is the distance traveled when accelerating 3m/s/s from rest).

This calculator uses all of the SI prefixes with u for micro, and D for deka (all the rest are the commonly accepted abbreviations).
