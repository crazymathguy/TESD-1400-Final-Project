# TESD-1400-Final-Project
This is my final project for the Southwest Technical College TESD 1400 course.

This project is a scientific calculator. It converts units and finds missing information (e.g. what is the distance traveled when accelerating 3m/s/s from rest).

This calculator uses all of the SI prefixes with u for micro, and D for deka (all the rest are the commonly accepted abbreviations).

Units with powers (such as square meters or cubic decimeters [liters]) are represented with a number directly following the unit: for example, m^2 would be written as m2.
